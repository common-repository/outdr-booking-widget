Add a modern booking experience to your outdoor activity website, which engages your users and generates more business. Links directly to your school's [Outdr.com](https://outdr.com) account and calendar.

== Description ==

By adding a friendly and responsive chat-style booking experience to your website, that immediately engages potential customers, you can ensure that you receive all the information you need to reply immediately. 

Rather than just using emails, the Outdr Booking Widget is linked directly to your school's [Outdr.com](https://outdr.com) account, allowing you to view and manage all booking requests through your [Outdr.com](https://outdr.com) dashboard. Email notifications are sent to you every step of the way.

When your customers confirm a booking, the desposit payment is made securely online, and directly into your account.

The booking widget sends form contents to [Outdr.com](https://outdr.com).  Please review _Outdr.com_'s [privacy policy](https://outdr.com/policy/privacy) and [terms of service](https://outdr.com/policy/terms) before including this widget on your site.
